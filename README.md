## 📘 Project Overview

This project aims to create a prescriptive analytics tool using dietary and exercise datasets, combining real-world and simulated data to produce actionable insights through a Linear Optimization Model.

### 🔹 Data Preparation

1. The `data/` directory is generated by running the `scripts/prepare_data.py` script. This script:
   - Downloads datasets from Kaggle
   - Cleans and preprocesses the data
   - Simulates missing data where needed

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed in the `eda/` directory to better understand the structure and quality of the final diet dataset.

3. The exercise dataset is based on:
   - The "Top 50 Exercises" dataset from Kaggle
   - Supplementary data from [Harvard Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diet-and-weight-loss/calories-burned-in-30-minutes-for-people-of-three-different-weights)

4. The combined dataset was cleaned and pre-processed with assistance from ChatGPT.

5. Final datasets for both the exercise and diet data are derived from Kaggle and enhanced with simulated data.
